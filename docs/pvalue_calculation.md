### Some Definitions

- $n_t$: The number of time points (cardinality) in the set $\{(f_{ai},f_{bi})|f_{detected}<f<f_{fixed}\}$.
- $f_{ai}, f_{bi}$: The frequency of mutation $a|b$ at time point $i$ 
- $f_i$: The mean of two mutations at time point $i$
- $\sigma_i^2$: The variance of the paired time series at time $i$
- $\bar{d}$: The average of the differences between both time series
- $\sigma_p^2$: Variance for the pair of mutational time series.

### Background
The expected value and variance of $n$ random independant draws from a normal distribution

### The Math

The script calculates the relative similarity between all pairs of mutational time series with $n_t$ time points with frequencies in the range $f_{detected}< f < f_{fixed}$. These are consistent with $n$ independent draws from a normal distribution, assuming a variance of

1. $\sigma_i^2=\frac{1}{n_t}f_i(1-f_i)$

where $f_i$ is the mean frequency of both mutations at each time point. The variance $\sigma_{tot}$ for the pair of mutational time series is calculated as the mean of the variance at all time points:

2. $\sigma_{p}^2 = \frac{1}{n_t}\sum_{i}^{n_t} \sigma_i^2 = \frac{1}{n_t^2} \sum_i^{n_t}f_i(1-f_i)$

Since we are interested in the similarity between both mutational time series, we will compare the differences in values between both time series. Let $d_i =|f_{ai}-f_{bi}|$ for all time points $i$ yielding a mean of

3. $\bar{d} = \frac{1}{n_t}\sum_i^{n_t}d_i=\frac{1}{n_t}\sum_i^{n_t}|f_{ai}-f_{bi}|â€‹$

Finally, given $\sigma_p$ and $\bar{d}$ we can calculate the probability that this pair of mutations belong to the same genotype using the cumulative probability distribution of the normal distribution:

4. $$
     p_{pair}=1 - \int_{- \infty}^{\bar{d}/\sigma_p} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-x^2/2} dx \equiv 1-erf[\frac{\bar{d}}{\sqrt{2\sigma_p^2}}]
     $$







### Notes

For each pair we discarded a time point if both $f_{ai}$ and $f_{bi}$ failed the condition $f_{detected} < f < f_{fixed}$, where $f_{detected}=0.03$ and $f_{fixed}=0.97$. Note the these filters check "greater than" and "less than", and NOT "equals to". This won't affect the results that much, but should be clarified since it affects repeatability.
